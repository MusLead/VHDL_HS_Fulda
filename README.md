# VHDL_1515659
### Do not forget to pull git always into the currently using computer BEFORE EDITING THE PROJECT!
Please when create a file for the future project save the VHDL files separately from the project file. In the future, project file will not be commited to reduce failure parsing xml and simulating from different version. try to creat project adnd add files instead of accesing the vivado files from git.

DO NOT EVER COPY THE SRC FILE INTO PROJECT FILE. LET THE PROJECT FILE ACCESS THE SOURCE FROM EXTERNAL PATH (NOT FORM WITHIN ITS FOLDER)

TODO: TRY TO UPDATE THE THE SOURCE FIE ADDER (src_adder) WITH SOURCE CODE FROM FILE PROJECT IF THE UEBUNG1 FINISHEED!
try to document how this TODO aboive possible

I might also in the future create a new git and delete this git. The vivado project should acces the data outside from the folder project. The vivado project it self should not be uploaded into git.
